Examples showing how to use vmlens to write multi-threaded tests for the JVM.

The classes in the package com.vmlens.examples.tests [are described here](https://vmlens.com/help/manual/#interleave) and [the JavaDoc is here.](https://vmlens.com/apidocs/vmlens-examples/)

When running the examples, you need to make sure that vmlens is added as Java-agent to the JVM.
